                    <p class="hobby-description">Chess has been a lifelong passion of mine. I'm captivated by the infinite possibilities that emerge from a simple 8×8 board with 32 pieces. What I love most about chess is how it combines logical calculation with creative intuition, requiring both mathematical precision and artistic vision.</p>
                    <p class="hobby-description">I enjoy studying classic games from grandmasters, exploring different opening strategies, and occasionally participating in online tournaments. For me, chess isn't just a game—it's a powerful metaphor for life itself, teaching patience, foresight, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>

                    <p class="hobby-description">Philosophy is more than an academic interest for me—it's a way of approaching life with curiosity and critical thinking. I enjoy contemplating fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, ethics, and meaning. This philosophical inquiry helps me examine my own assumptions and develop a more coherent worldview.</p>
                    <p class="hobby-description">I'm particularly interested in:</p>
                    <ul class="hobby-list">
                        <li>Existentialist philosophy and questions of meaning and authenticity</li>

                    <p class="hobby-description">I've always been fascinated by scientific theories that attempt to explain the fundamental nature of reality. From quantum mechanics to evolutionary biology, I enjoy learning about how scientists make sense of the natural world through careful observation, experimentation, and theoretical modeling.</p>
                    <p class="hobby-description">Some scientific areas that particularly captivate me include:</p>

                    <p class="hobby-description">I find that understanding science enriches my appreciation of the natural world and provides a powerful framework for distinguishing reliable knowledge from speculation.</p>

                    <p class="hobby-description">Some of my most meaningful moments come from simply wondering about the vastness of the cosmos, the mysteries of the deep sea, and the unfathomable expanse of time. These contemplations give me a sense of perspective that I find both humbling and awe-inspiring.</p>
                    <p class="hobby-description">I'm particularly drawn to:</p>
