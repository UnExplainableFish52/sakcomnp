                <h2 class="thought-question">What is life?</h2>
                <div class="thought-body">
                    <p>Life feels less like a straight line and more like the pulse between breath and pause. It is the collection of small, unnoticed decisions that, when stacked together, shape the myth we tell ourselves about who we are. In quiet moments I see life as a conversation between curiosity and limitation, a kind of experiment where every outcome is provisional.</p>
                    <p>To live, then, is to keep negotiating that conversation with gentleness. I do not think life demands certainty or even brilliance; it asks only that we stay awake to the textures of the day. The joy, the ache, the boredom—they are all dialects of the same invitation: remain present, improvise, and let the story keep unfolding.</p>

                <h2 class="thought-question">What is happiness?</h2>
                <div class="thought-body">
                    <p>Happiness is not a destination I can sprint toward; it is the subtle warmth that appears when my actions align with my values. Sometimes it is loud—laughter thick with friends and late nights. Mostly it arrives quietly, like noticing the sun has already risen while I was lost in a sentence I loved writing.</p>
                    <p>Modern life sells happiness as a trophy, but I find it behaves more like a practice. It grows when I offer attention to ordinary scenes: washing the mug I always reach for, replying to a message with intention, letting someone else feel seen. Happiness is grounded, not glamorous; it is the permission to rest in who we are becoming.</p>

                <h2 class="thought-question">Why do we chase meaning?</h2>
                <div class="thought-body">
                    <p>I suspect we chase meaning because silence unnerves us. The vastness of experience needs a container, and stories are the vessels we keep refilling. Meaning is how we weave the random data of our days into a pattern that steadies us when grief, doubt, or change arrive uninvited.</p>
                    <p>The search itself is a kind of compass. Even when the answer shifts, the act of looking keeps us moving toward honesty. We invent rituals, build projects, and choose people who reflect the version of ourselves we wish to nurture. Meaning is not an answer we find; it is a craft we maintain, stitch by imperfect stitch.</p>

                <h2 class="thought-question">How do we sit with uncertainty?</h2>
                <div class="thought-body">
                    <p>Uncertainty is the native climate of any honest life. I used to fight it, building elaborate plans to barricade the unknown. Now I try to see uncertainty as an invitation to curiosity, a reminder that I am still capable of being surprised by myself and the world.</p>
                    <p>Sitting with uncertainty means letting questions breathe. It asks for rhythms that anchor me—journaling, long walks, conversations where listening matters more than winning. When I treat uncertainty as a collaborator rather than an enemy, possibility widens. The future stays unwritten, yes, but it also remains open.</p>
